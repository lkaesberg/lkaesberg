Place your 3D model files in this directory.

## Required Models

- `rocket.glb` - A low-poly rocket model used for the spaceship in the solar system.

You can find free 3D models on sites like:

- [TurboSquid](https://www.turbosquid.com/Search/3D-Models/free)
- [Poly Pizza](https://poly.pizza/)

## Model Requirements

For optimal performance, models should:
- Be low-poly (under 10,000 polygons)
- Have simple textures
- Be in GLB format (GLTF Binary)
- Have appropriate licensing for your use case
